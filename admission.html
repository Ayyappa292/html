The top five engineering entrance exams taken by a large number of students each year are:

JEE Main - Conducted by National Testing Agency, JEE Main is the entrance examination for BTech admissions into NITs, IIITs and GFTIs. JEE Main consists of two papers - Paper 1 (BE/BTech) and Paper 2 (BArch/BPlan)
JEE Advanced - It is a national level entrance examination for BTech admissions into IITs. Students have to qualify for JEE Main to attempt JEE Advanced.
